Sorry, I forgot to answer that question.\n\nThe states vector (vector<arma::Col<size_t> >) are the states which\ncorrespond to each observation (the observations vector,\nvector<arma::Mat<double> >).  When you train the HMM with Train(), it is\ntraining with labeled data.  So for each observation, you need to pass\nthe corresponding label.  That is, states[i] is the index of the hidden\nstate corresponding with observations[i].\n\nIn the example you gave, you were only using one hidden state, so the\nstates vector should be entirely filled with zeroes, and be the same\nlength as the observations vector.\n\nThank you for pointing out these issues.

I have already changed my code a bit so that the \nvalues per sample are stored in a different column of the \n\"vector<arma::Mat<double> >\", meaning that each column contains a \nsequence of values for one video sample and the amount of rows is equal \nto the amount of video samples used. I hope this is the way it is \nsupposed to be done, as I have no way of testing it until the my problem \nwith states is fixed.\n","Hi I am a student at the University of Calgary and interested in working =\non one of your projects for GSoC.

There are several\nways to do this:\n\n  (1) \n\nInstead of finding k nearest neighbors, find a * k nearest neighbors\nwhere a is some integer (I chose 10).  Then apply the transformation\nmatrix and do a brute-force search in the a * k nearest neighbors of\neach point.  Every now and then, the tree gets fully rebuilt.  This\ngives approximate solutions, though.  This is what we chose to do.\n\n  (2)\n\nFor each point x in S_i, you have some corresponding point x' in\nS_{i + 1}.  It seems like, in general, || x - x' || is small.\n\nEach BinarySpaceTree<> node has a corresponding HRectBound<>, which is\nthe hyperrectangle bound that represents the enclosing hyperrectangle of\nall the points in the node.\n\nYou could loop over each point in S_{i + 1}, find the BinarySpaceTree<>\nnode it is a part of, and then expand the HRectBound associated with\nthat node accordingly (using operator|=()).  You'd also need to expand\nthe HRectBounds of any parent nodes.\n\nThis would mean your BinarySpaceTree is no longer a space partitioning\ntree -- the nodes would be overlapping.  For AllkNN this is not a\nproblem; it will still work, but it may affect the runtime adversely,\nespecially as the bounding hyperrectangles become larger and larger.  In\nthe limit case you would get a tree with no discriminatory capabilities\nbecause all the bounding hyperrectangles are huge.\n\n  (3)\n\nYou could avoid modifying the hyperrectangles associated with each tree\nnode by taking each point x' and finding which node it fits into, and\nplacing it in that node (whereas x may have been in a different node).\nYou could also split a node if it now has more points than the leafSize,\nand delete nodes when they have no points in them.\n\nI am not sure about the running time of this approach, but your tree\nwould still be valid for any number of iterations and it would probably\nstill run all-NN search quickly (as opposed to approach (2)).\n\n----\n\nAre these ideas helpful?  I think I understood the problem.\n\nAs long as you have some sort of valid tree structure with valid\nbounding rectangles, the NeighborSearch class will find the correct,\nexact nearest neighbors.\n\n-- \nRyan Curtin       | \"Think!

The type std::vector<arma::mat> is meant to hold a sequence of\ndata sequences.  I think you are saying that if you are using 5 videos,\neach video is an individual arma::mat stored in the\nstd::vector<arma::mat>.

If you aren't using trunk,\ntry doing that ('svn co http://svn.cc.gatech.edu/fastlab/mlpack/trunk\nmlpack').  I recently committed a fix which adds some small values to\nthe covariance matrices so that they don't end up being entirely\nzero-valued.  That situation arises when the initial clustering to set\nthe Gaussians returns a cluster with only one point in it (by default\nthis is K-Means).\n\nI'll try and hunt down the -nan issue, although it is worth pointing out\nthat the log-likelihood of the model is correctly -nan if there exist\npoints which are very far outside any of the Gaussians.  That is, if the\nprobability of an individual point is 0, then log(0) = -nan and the\nlog-likelihood of the whole model is -nan.  I'll let you know what I\nfind as I dig into it.  Thanks for attaching the test case -- this makes\ndebugging much easier.\n\nThanks for pointing out these issues.\n\nRyan\n\n-- \nRyan Curtin       | \"You got to stick with your principles.\"\nryan@igglybob.com |   - Harry Waters\n_______________________________________________\nmlpack mailing list\nmlpack@cc.gatech.edu\nhttps://mailman.cc.gatech.edu/mailman/listinfo/mlpack\n","Thanks for your help, Ryan!\n\nI'm testing out the latest now.

Also, Google pays a stipend of $500 to us for each\naccepted student, which, because we don't really have any costs, can go\ndirectly to the mentor.  I need to look further into the precise details\nof that.\n\nUh, yeah, so: mentor a student, get $500 and maybe a t-shirt.\n\nThe steps to apply for mentorship should be on the webpage.  If you have\nany questions, feel free to email me.\n\nThe student questions should start rolling in shortly.

For the discrete distribution, casting the\nintegers to doubles should work, but this is not an optimal solution:\n\n  arma::Mat<double> handobservations;\n  for (uint i = 0; i < hands.size(); i++)\n  {\n    handobservations << (double) hands[i] << arma::endr;\n    handvector.push_back(handobservations);\n    handobservations.clear();\n  }\n\nIn the coming days I will refactor the HMM class so that for\nDiscreteDistribution, arma::Mat<int> will be accepted (as it should be).\nThis will be slightly involved because it means each distribution type\nwill have to define its own observation type (arma::Mat<int> for\nDiscreteDistribution, arma::Mat<double> for GaussianDistribution, and so\nforth).\n\nI will also write more complete documentation and a tutorial for HMMs,\nand then I'll let you know when that is all done.  In the mean time, the\nfix I proposed above should work.  If it doesn't, or you have any other\nquestions, let me know.\n\n-- \nRyan Curtin       | \"Get off my lawn!\"\nryan@igglybob.com |   - Kowalski\n_______________________________________________\nmlpack mailing list\nmlpack@cc.gatech.edu\nhttps://mailman.cc.gatech.edu/mailman/listinfo/mlpack\n","On 03/14/2013 07:43 PM, Ryan Curtin wrote:\n> On Thu, Mar 14, 2013 at 12:29:53PM +0100, Jaelon wrote:\n>> Hey,\n>>\n>>   I have yet another question about the hmm from mlpack, more precisely\n>>   about the syntax for observations.\n>>   I wil be using the \"Train (const std::vector< arma::mat > &dataSeq)\"\n>>   thus without the labeled data so the Baum-welch algorithm will be used.\n>>   But when using it with dataseq filled up with data that is observable i\n>>   get an error: Mat::operator(): out of bounds.\n>>   Here is what I put in there:\n>>     * I have a vectors of integers (which i convert to double for now)\n>>       for each timestamp, thus lets say one vector for each frame of a\n>>       video.\n>>     * These vectors are of variable length (1 or 2)\n>>     * There are multiple video's to train the hmm (obviously :p)\n>>     * Now I use the dataseq as a vector containing the data from all\n>>       videos.

Many of those nonlinear\ndimensionality techniques are slow.  Instead what would be more\ninteresting is a working implementation of MVU with LRSDP (see the end\nof the ideas list).\n\nThere is no purpose in mlpack implementing a variety of methods poorly.\nBreadth is important but it cannot come at the cost of quality.\n\nIf you are going to propose implementing all (or even some) (or more\nthan one) of these methods, you will have to convince us that you can\nimplement all of them effectively.  And with tests.  Proper unit tests\nare very important, and, testing machine learning methods for accuracy\n-- especially when most of the \"tests\" available are just reference\nimplementations which could contain bugs -- is a rather difficult task\nwhich can take far longer than implementing the methods itself.\n\nAlso, if you were planning to just wrap the MATLAB functions or\n\"translate\" them to C++, that's not acceptable.  The implementation must\nbe from the ground up and needs to be provably faster than any existing\nimplementations to be accepted into the mlpack codebase (of course, you\ncan't know that when you propose the project, but if you have papers\nwhich detail faster algorithms to implement, those are a good start).\n\n> There are also many kernel functions which have not been implemented.\n> \n> http://crsouza.blogspot.in/2010/03/kernel-functions-for-machine-learning.html\n\nI could implement these, fully with tests, in probably a day and a half.\nThis could be an addendum onto an existing project but is too simple for\nsomeone with knowledge as advanced as yourself.\n\nHopefully these are helpful answers.

Is this correct?\n\nHello Robert,\n\nOpenCV focuses on computer vision (hence the name) whereas mlpack\nfocuses on large-scale statistical learning techniques.  mlpack is more\napplicable to people who are either looking to try less standard machine\nlearning algorithms (i.e. sparse coding, LARS, density estimation trees,\netc.) or who are looking to modify our flexible algorithms for the\npurposes of their research.  To that end, for instance, any user can\nwrite their own distance metric and plug it in to mlpack code (without\nany runtime penalty).\n\nYou are right that we aren't very interested in wrapping other libraries\n(other than Armadillo).  Some libraries -- especially scientific\nlibraries (cough cough Boost.math) -- change APIs in unexpected ways and\nthis makes maintenance an ugly proposition filled with #ifdefs and other\nhackery.  Instead, our goal is to, at the machine learning method level,\nkeep things in-house for the sake of maintainability.\n\nWe'd love to have an SVM implementation someday, but there isn't too\nmuch point in producing one if it can't outperform libsvm (if it can't,\nthere's not too much motivation to use our implementation).\n\nDoes this clarify things?
